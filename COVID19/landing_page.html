      <h2 class="display-3">What is COVID-19?</h2>
      <p>
        The 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute
        respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cases of the outbreak were first identified in the city of Wuhan,
        Hubei, China in December 2019, and later was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March
        2020. As of 20 March, more than 253,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in at least 180 countries and territories,
        resulting in more than 10,400 deaths and 89,000 recoveries.
      </p>
      <p>The virus primarily spreads between people via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. It is considered most
      contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread is possible even before symptoms appear. The time between
      exposure and symptom onset is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days. Common symptoms
      include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress
      syndrome. Specific antiviral treatment is not available at the moment, though treatment efforts consist of symptom
      alleviation and supportive therapy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Recommended Preventive Measures are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-Monitoring and Self-Quarantine</li>
        <li>Proper Hand Washing</li>
        <li>Covering Mouth While Coughing and Sneezing </li>
        <li>Social Distancing</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="display-3">What the App does?</h2>
      <p>
        The Application is an initiative to make the people more Socially Responsible by helping the concerned authority keep
        track of whether they are showing any symptoms of the Coronavirus disease. It also helps in raising awareness about the
        number of people affected by the virus in their surroundings, hence helping them be more careful while travelling out of
        their homes. This initiative also encourages faster medical attention to people most likely to be affected by predicting
        the nature of their symptoms. This application helps people to get one step closer to being safe as well as help to keep
        the people around them safe.
      </p>
